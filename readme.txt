This plugin adds useful admin settings links and massive resources for Genesis Framework and its ecosystem to the WordPress Toolbar / Admin Bar.

== Description ==

= Quick Access to Genesis Framework Resources - Time Saver! =
This plugin just adds **a lot Genesis Framework related resources** to your toolbar / admin bar. Also links to **all settings pages** of this framework are added making life for webmasters a lot easier. So you might just switch from the frontend of your site to the Genesis 'Theme Settings' or adjust additional extensions like 'Genesis Simple Hooks', 'AgentPress Listings', 'Genesis Media Project' etc. -- Use this time saver and get quicker access :-)

= General Features =
* The plugin is **primarily intended towards site admins and webmasters**.
* All the Framework settings links, plus support for all official child themes, plus support for almost all other child themes available, including from StudioPress Marketplace, the "Themedy" and "Allure Themes" brands, as well as from third-party developers and other marketplaces, for full list [see "Other Notes" here](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/genesis-toolbar-extras/other_notes/)
* Support for all official plugins by StudioPress, plus all third-party community extensions as well as plugins from the "ecosystem", for full list [see "Other Notes" here](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/genesis-toolbar-extras/other_notes/)
* A massive list of resource & community links is included: support forums, tutorials, code snippets, translations etc.
* A special "Manage Content" group where plugins like "AgentPress Listings", "Premise" or "Genesis Media Project" or other custom post types from some child themes hook in -- so you can very easily manage this framework/child theme related content stuff from your toolbar!
* The added menu items by the plugin follow the same user cabalities as their original links - in other words: if a link to a settings page is not displayed without my plugin for a certain user role/capability it won't be when my plugin is active!
* Support for user profile options regarding Genesis admin menus: So, if a user won't see the left-hand Genesis icon, the same user won't see any Genesis toolbar items!
* 9 additional icon colors included :) (changeable via filters)
* 4 filters included to change wording/tooltip and icon of the main item - for more info [see FAQ section here](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/genesis-toolbar-extras/faq/)
* For custom "branding" or special needs a few sections like "Extensions" and "Resource links group" could be hidden from displaying via your active child theme - for more info [see FAQ section here](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/genesis-toolbar-extras/faq/)
* Fully internationalized! Real-life tested and developed with international users in mind!
* Fully WPML compatible!

= Special Features =
* Not only supporting official Genesis/StudioPress sites but ALSO third-party stuff and user links - so just the whole Genesis ecosystem :)
* Plugin includes a little CSS fix for older (prior of January 2012) child themes to proper display second-level links for frontend toolbar/admin bar items
* Link to GenesisFinder search engine included!
* Links to Genesis translations project and forums included - to spread the word and better connect the community
* Links to downloadable German language packs - only displayed when German locales are active (de_DE, de_AT, de_CH, de_LU)
* *NOTE:* I would be happy to add more language/locale specific resources and more useful third-party links - just contact me!

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `genesis-toolbar-extras` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Look at your toolbar / admin bar for "Genesis" and enjoy using the new links there :)
4. Go and manage your framework, child theme and/or extensions settings :)

**Please note, this plugin requires WordPress 3.3 or higher in order to work!**

**Also note:** This plugin has NO settings page because I believe it's just not neccessarry. All customizing could be done via filters, constants and regular WordPress user roles & capabilities. As the plugin is indended for a shop manager/ admin/ webmaster use that's the way to go. This way we can save the overhaul of an options panel/settings page, additional database requests, uninstall routines and such. End result: a lightweight system that just works and saves clicks & time :-).

**Multisite install:** Yes, it's fully compatible but have a look in the [FAQ section here](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/genesis-toolbar-extras/faq/) for more info :)

**Own translation/wording:** For custom and update-secure language files please upload them to `/wp-content/languages/genesis-toolbar-extras/` (just create this folder) - This enables you to use fully custom translations that won't be overridden on plugin updates. Also, complete custom English wording is possible with that, just use a language file like `genesis-toolbar-extras-en_US.mo/.po` to achieve that (for creating one see the tools on "Other Notes").

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why another Genesis Toolbar plugin, there are already some others!? =
You're right! If you're happy with one of the others then that's absolutely great and you don't need to switch anything! :)
I just made this new plugin here for my own needs and some of my client admins. As I am an open source evangelist I like to release my stuff to give back to the community!

The main purpose of my plugin here is to have all things under one roof. So if you're the admin and running Genesis plus a child theme and a few of the Genesis plugins on your site you then have the full experience: all settings links from almost all stuff available. All is working out of the box so you can concentrate on your work and content! It's a huge time saver! And, since all third-party stuff and community resources are supported as well you're not left alone in the dark! The official stuff by StudioPress is incredible awesome but we have a BIG Genesis community and ecosystem out there. My mission is to support all from that if at all possible - I'll add support for new stuff if something gets released. Of course, this will be maintained as I use and need such a kind of plugin in my own daily work!

One plugin to rule them all :-)

= Does this plugin work with latest WP version and also older versions? =
Yes, this plugin works really fine with the latest WordPress 3.3+!
And sorry, it DOES NOT work with older WordPress versions so please update your install if you haven't done yet :).

= How are new resources being added to the toolbar/admin bar? =
Just drop me a note on [my Twitter @deckerweb](http://twitter.com/deckerweb) or via my contact page and I'll add the link if it is useful for admins/ webmasters and the Genesis #genesiswp community.

= How could my plugin/extension or child theme options page be added to the toolbar/admin bar links? =
This is possible of course and highly welcomed! Just drop me a note on [my Twitter @deckerweb](http://twitter.com/deckerweb) or via my contact page and we sort out the details!
Particularly, I need the admin url for the primary options page (like so `wp-admin/admin.php?page=foo`) - this is relevant for both, plugins and child themes. For child themes then I also need the correct name defined in the stylesheet (like so `Footheme`). (Note: I don't own all the premium stuff myself yet so you're more than welcomed to help me out with these things. Thank you!)

= Is this plugin Multisite compatible? =
Yes, it is! :) Works really fine in Multisite invironment - it will ever ONLY display for admins or users who can see the left-hand "G" menu. Still, I just recommend to activate on a per site basis so to load things only where and when needed.

= In Multisite, could I "network activate" this plugin? =
Yes, you could! It will ever ONLY display for admins or users who can see the left-hand "G" menu so you're on the safe side :). Of course it makes only sense if you have one or more sites running with Genesis in your Multisite environment. However, it's a lightweight plugin but activation on a per site basis is the recommended way from my point of view. Almost all admin links are intended for a per-site use and not for network-related stuff.

= Can certain sections be removed? =
Yes, this is possible! You can remove the following sections: "Child Theme" area (all items) / "Extensions" (main item + sub items!) / "Manage Content" group (all items) / "Resources link group" at the bottom (all items) / "German language stuff" (all items) / "Translations" (all items)

To achieve this add one, some or all of the following constants to your child theme's `functions.php` file:
`
/** Genesis Toolbar Extras: Remove Child Theme Items */
define( 'GTBE_CHILD_THEME_DISPLAY', FALSE );

/** Genesis Toolbar Extras: Remove Extensions Items */
define( 'GTBE_EXTENSIONS_DISPLAY', FALSE );

/** Genesis Toolbar Extras: Remove Manage Content Items */
define( 'GTBE_MANAGE_CONTENT_DISPLAY', FALSE );

/** Genesis Toolbar Extras: Remove Resource Items */
define( 'GTBE_RESOURCES_DISPLAY', FALSE );

/** Genesis Toolbar Extras: Remove German Language Items */
define( 'GTBE_DE_DISPLAY', FALSE );

/** Genesis Toolbar Extras: Remove Translations Items */
define( 'GTBE_TRANSLATIONS_DISPLAY', FALSE );
`

= Can the the whole toolbar entry be removed, especially for certain users? =
Yes, that's also possible! This could be useful if your site has special user roles/capabilities or other settings that are beyond the default WordPress stuff etc. For example: if you want to disable the display of any "Genesis Toolbar Extras" items for all user roles of "Editor" please use this code:
`
/** Genesis Toolbar Extras: Remove all items for "Editor" user role */
if ( current_user_can( 'editor' ) ) {
	define( 'GTBE_DISPLAY', FALSE );
}
`

To hide only from the user with a user ID of "2":
`
/** Genesis Toolbar Extras: Remove all items for user ID 2 */
if ( 2 == get_current_user_id() ) {
	define( 'GTBE_DISPLAY', FALSE );
}
`

To hide items only in frontend use this code:
`
/** Genesis Toolbar Extras: Remove all items from frontend */
if ( !is_admin() ) {
	define( 'GTBE_DISPLAY', FALSE );
}
`

In general, use this constant do hide any "Genesis Toolbar Extras" items:
`
/** Genesis Toolbar Extras: Remove all items */
define( 'GTBE_DISPLAY', FALSE );
`


= Available Filters to Customize More Stuff =
All filters are listed with the filter name in bold and the below additional info, helper functions (if available) as well as usage examples.

**gtbe_filter_capability_all**

* Default value: `edit_posts` (needed for the "manage content" stuff...)
* 5 Predefined helper functions:
 * `__gtbe_admin_only` -- returns `'administrator'` role -- usage:
`
add_filter( 'gtbe_filter_capability_all', '__gtbe_admin_only' );
`
 * `__gtbe_role_editor` -- returns `'editor'` role -- usage:
`
add_filter( 'gtbe_filter_capability_all', '__gtbe_role_editor' );
`
 * `__gtbe_cap_edit_theme_options` -- returns `'edit_theme_options'` capability -- usage:
`
add_filter( 'gtbe_filter_capability_all', '__gtbe_cap_edit_theme_options' );
`
 * `__gtbe_cap_manage_options` -- returns `'manage_options'` capability -- usage:
`
add_filter( 'gtbe_filter_capability_all', '__gtbe_cap_manage_options' );
`
 * `__gtbe_cap_install_plugins` -- returns `'install_plugins'` capability -- usage:
`
add_filter( 'gtbe_filter_capability_all', '__gtbe_cap_install_plugins' );
`
* Another example:
`
add_filter( 'gtbe_filter_capability_all', 'custom_gtbe_capability_all' );
/**
 * Genesis Toolbar Extras: Change Main Capability
 */
function custom_gtbe_capability_all() {
	return 'switch_themes';
}
`
--> Changes the capability to `switch_themes`

**gtbe_filter_main_icon**

* Default value: Genesis "G" logo (favicon) with turquoise/light blue touch... :)
* 9 Predefined helper functions for the 9 included colored icons, returning special colored icon values - the helper function always has this name: `__gtbe_colornamehere_icon()` this results in the following filters ready for usage:
`
add_filter( 'gtbe_filter_main_icon', '__gtbe_brown_icon' );

add_filter( 'gtbe_filter_main_icon', '__gtbe_darkblue_icon' );

add_filter( 'gtbe_filter_main_icon', '__gtbe_green_icon' );

add_filter( 'gtbe_filter_main_icon', '__gtbe_ivory_icon' );

add_filter( 'gtbe_filter_main_icon', '__gtbe_orange_icon' );

add_filter( 'gtbe_filter_main_icon', '__gtbe_pink_icon' );

add_filter( 'gtbe_filter_main_icon', '__gtbe_red_icon' );

add_filter( 'gtbe_filter_main_icon', '__gtbe_white_icon' );

add_filter( 'gtbe_filter_main_icon', '__gtbe_yellow_icon' );
`
* Another example:
`
add_filter( 'gtbe_filter_main_icon', 'custom_gtbe_main_icon' );
/**
 * Genesis Toolbar Extras: Change Main Icon
 */
function custom_gtbe_main_icon() {
	return get_stylesheet_directory_uri() . '/images/custom-icon.png';
}
`
--> Uses a custom image from your active child theme's `/images/` folder
--> Recommended dimensions are 16px x 16px

**gtbe_filter_main_icon_display**

* Returning the CSS class for the main item icon
* Default value: `icon-genesistbe` (class is: `.icon-genesistbe`)
* 1 Predefined helper function:
 * `__gtbe_no_icon_display()` -- usage:
`
add_filter( 'gtbe_filter_main_icon_display', '__gtbe_no_icon_display' );
`
 * This way you can REMOVE the icon!
* Another example:
`
add_filter( 'gtbe_filter_main_icon_display', 'custom_gtbe_main_icon_display_class' );
/**
 * Genesis Toolbar Extras: Change Main Icon CSS Class
 */
function custom_gtbe_main_icon_display_class() {
	return 'your-custom-icon-class';
}
`
--> You then have to define CSS rules in your theme/child theme stylesheet for your own custom class `.your-custom-icon-class`

**gtbe_filter_main_item**

* Default value: "Genesis"
* Example code for your child theme's `functions.php` file:
`
add_filter( 'gtbe_filter_main_item', 'custom_gtbe_main_item' );
/**
 * Genesis Toolbar Extras: Change Main Item Name
 */
function custom_gtbe_main_item() {
	return __( 'Your custom main item', 'your-child-theme-textdomain' );
}
`

**gtbe_filter_main_item_tooltip**

* Default value: "Genesis Framework"
* Example code for your child theme's `functions.php` file:
`
add_filter( 'gtbe_filter_main_item_tooltip', 'custom_gtbe_main_item_tooltip' );
/**
 * Genesis Toolbar Extras: Change Main Item Name's Tooltip
 */
function custom_gtbe_main_item_tooltip() {
	return __( 'Your custom main item tooltip', 'your-child-theme-textdomain' );
}
`

**gtbe_filter_genesis_name** and **gtbe_filter_genesis_name_tooltip**

* Default value for both: "Genesis"
* Used for some items within toolbar links to enable proper branding
* Change things like in the other examples/principles shown above

**Final note:** If you don't like to add your customizations to your child theme's `functions.php` file you can also add them to a functionality plugin or an mu-plugin. This way you can also use this better for Multisite environments. In general you are then more independent from child theme changes etc.

All the custom & branding stuff code above can also be found as a Gist on Github: https://gist.github.com/2198788 (you can also add your questions/ feedback there :)

*Note:* All my plugins are localized/ translateable by default. This is very important for all users worldwide. So please contribute your language to the plugin to make it even more useful.
